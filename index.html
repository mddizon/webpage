            <p>Below are examples of projects I have done outside of work that I am particularly proud of</p>
            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <h3>Auto Immune Game</h3>
                <p>Worked on the this game with my best friend during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a tower defense game focusing on building the best immune response to defend against an oncoming virus attack. If this sounds interesting, please consider <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139330/Auto_Immune/">wishlisting the game on steam</a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <h3>Armed And Dangerous</h3>
                <p>A game I helped make in Godot for the 2024 GMTK Game Jam. The theme was <i>Build To Scale</i>. Our take on the idea was a space shooter, where your character has a ship with no weapons, and you have the technology to grow your body so large that your arms poke out of the ship and you fight enemies like that. The absurdity still makes me laugh.</p>

            <div class="portfolio-item">
                <h3>Scylla Custom Keyboard</h3>
                <p>A hobby electronics kit I purchased from BastardKB. Uses Zilent V2 switches and an arduino microcontroller. My first real project soldering SMD components.</p>
